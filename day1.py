# 2. multi line / doc string
"""this code print hello world.

# Syntax:
# grammar of programming language
# rules that controls structure of symbols, punctuation, words of programming language

# indentation:
# 4 space is indentation

# Data Type:
# classification of data

# Variable:
# container which contains/stores data

# a = 12
# b = 3.14


# Variable naming rules:
"""
1. variable name cannot start with number
2. Variable name cannot contain special characters except underscore (_)
3. Variable name shouldn't be reserved keyword
4. Variable name cannot contain space
"""

# Multiculture:
# process of naming variable with multiple words

# 1. Pascal Case
# most commonly used for class names
# first letter of each word should be capital letter
# Example:
# MyAgeIs = 1

# 2. Camel Case
# first letter of first word should be small. First letter of other words should be capital
# Example:
# myAgeIs = 1

# 3. Snake Case
# commonly used for naming variable and function
# each word should be separated by underscore
# Example:
# my_age_is = 1

# not recommended:
# myageis = 1
# MYAGEIS = 2
# mYnaMeiS = 2
